In this project I'm exploring global Covid-19 data to gain insights and find possible corralations with different stats.

To properly view the plots, please follow the following steps:
1. Open 'general_covid.ipynb' and wait for it to fully load.
2. Hover over the icon that looks like a 'no entry' traffic sign and press 'external view available with nbviewer'.
