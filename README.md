In this project I'm exploring global Covid-19 data to gain insights and find possible corralations with different stats.

To properly view the plots online, using nbviewer, please follow the following steps:
1. Open https://github.com/alons123/covid-19-exploration/blob/master/general_covid.ipynb
2. Wait for it to fully load.
3. Hover over the icon that looks like a 'no entry' traffic sign and press 'external view available with nbviewer'.
